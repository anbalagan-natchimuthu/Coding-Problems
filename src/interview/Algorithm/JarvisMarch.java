/**
 *  JARVIS MARCH ALGORITHM
 * There are some trees, where each tree is represented by (x,y) coordinate in a two-dimensional garden.
 * Your job is to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope as it is expensive.
 * The garden is well fenced only if all the trees are enclosed. Your task is to help find the coordinates of trees
 * which are exactly located on the fence perimeter.

 Example 1:

 Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]
 Output: [[1,1],[2,0],[4,2],[3,3],[2,4]]
